# Market Risk Analysis System: Advanced Modeling for AAPL Stock Volatility and Price Prediction

This project focuses on assessing the historical volatility of Apple (AAPL) stock and forecasting potential future price movements using advanced data analysis techniques. By leveraging financial data analysis, statistical modeling, and risk assessment methods, valuable insights into AAPL stock's behavior and potential risks are provided.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze historical market data on AAPL stock price, including closing prices, volumes, and sentiment indicators.
- Assess the stock's volatility using Bollinger Bands analysis.
- Develop a Monte Carlo simulation model to generate possible price paths for AAPL stock.
- Estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) to quantify potential maximum loss with 95% confidence.

## Methodology




### Data Analysis

- Collected and analyzed historical market data on AAPL stock price.
- Explored key metrics such as closing prices, volumes, and sentiment indicators.

### Volatility Assessment

- Calculated the stock's volatility using Bollinger Bands analysis.
- Visualized historical volatility trends to identify patterns and fluctuations.


### High Volatility

Identified historical volatility of 91.28%, indicating significant price fluctuations. This is visually confirmed by the wide Bollinger Bands.
